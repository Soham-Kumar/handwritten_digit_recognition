For 1 epoch, the accuracy acheived on the MNIST's test data was 92.14%.
On increasing the epochs to 3, accuracy increased to 97.72%.

For 10 epochs, following were the consecutive values of accuracies in each repetition.
1.  92.42%
2.  96.70%
3.  97.65%
4.  98.32%
5.  98.73%
6.  98.93%
7.  99.19%
8.  99.34%
9.  99.32%
10.  99.53%

Increasing the number of epochs increases the accuracy in general, becoming stagnant after a certain time. Increasing the epochs too much can lead to overfitting, when a "a statistical model fits exactly against its training data...[but] cannot perform accurately against unseen data, defeating its purpose."
